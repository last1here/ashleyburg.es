      Hi, I'm Ash. A full stack developer from Manchester, UK. I am currently
      focusing on Web APIs and Single Page Application development using C#,
      Angular and other. I am currently employed by <a
      href="http://www.county-rental.co.uk/">County Car &amp; Van Hire</a> as a
      lead developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been a developer for over 7 years starting out with PHP, HTML and
      CSS. I moved on to a C# and Angular stack around 5 years ago and have
      focued on that since. Along the way I have worked with a bunch of frontend
      other frameworks such as Vue and React. Also other languages such as Swift
      and Kotline for some basic mobile development. Building both customer
      facing and internal software as allowed me to see various aspects of
      software development and tackle various complex tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is where I _plan_ (we shall see) to post about various technical
      tasks I have undertook and learnt from, as well as some none techical
      related things. Ideally I hope to use some of the posts as references to
      look back on in the future and potentially receive feedback on my posts in
      order to further the stuff I know and maybe learn somethings I dont.
    </p>
